# HW5
HW5

Complete the functions in main.jl as specified in the function signatures, so that all tests pass.

When tests pass, you can run  ```HW5.filter()```
to run an example Extended Kalman Filter run, which will print out relevant details. 

Notice from the output how the filter is able to identify the position, velocity and heading,
all from the bizarre and convoluted measurement recieved at each timestep. When you think about it, that is pretty remarkable!
